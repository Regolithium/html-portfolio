<h3> The Polar Express</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Christmas movie. I resonate with the main charater's disposition about christmas.</p>

<h3>UP</h3>
<p>The movie is so beautiful. I love the cross generational messages in the narrative.</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>This movie ages like wine. Each time I take a sip theres something new waiting to surprise me.</p>
